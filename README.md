Advanced predictive modeling and portfolio optimization for investment portfolios 

Predictive modeling - train a predictive model on historical data and rel. features 
    uses histoical data, economic indicators (ex. CPI, GDP, unemployment), and setiment analysis around a product (maybe expand on this area)
    neural network vs decision tree 

Optimization - feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning (grid search), creating a well-balanced portfolio by selecting a combination of investment options that maximizes returns and minimizes risks

Notes
CNN-LSTM model for prediction (hybrid ML model)
    CNN for feature engineering and LSTM for stock prediction 
Mean-Variance Optimization for portfolio optimization
